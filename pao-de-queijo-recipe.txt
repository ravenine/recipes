NGREDIENTS
1 egg*
1/3 cup olive oil
2/3 cup milk
1 1/2 cups (170 grams) tapioca flour
1/2 cup (packed, about 66 grams) grated cheese, your preference, 
we get good results with feta cheese (no need to grate), 
or fresh farmer's cheese (if using fresh farmer's cheese, 
you may want to add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt)
1 teaspoon of salt (or more to taste)

METHOD
1 Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Spread a little olive oil around the 
insides of each well of a mini-muffin tin.

2 Put all of the ingredients into a blender and pulse until smooth. 
You may need to use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the blender 
so that everything gets blended well. At this point you can store 
the batter in the refrigerator for up to a week.

3 Pour batter into prepared mini-muffin tin, not quite to the top; 
leave about 1/8 inch from the top.

4 Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until all puffy 
and just lightly browned. Remove from oven and let cool on a rack 
for a few minutes. Eat while warm or save to reheat later.
